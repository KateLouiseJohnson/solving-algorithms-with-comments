# One away from Cracking the coding interview
I sourced this one from [Cracking the coding interview, 6th edition](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

This problem asks, given two input strings, determine if they are 1 or 0 edits away from each other. An edit can be, as you would expect, a character is removed, inserted or replaced.
