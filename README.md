# A repo solving algorithms with heaps of console logs

I've got a bi ol' chip on my shoulder from never having completed a computer science degree and instead become a software engineer in an unconventional way. When it comes to white board challenges I suck! Fighting that imposter syndrome is a never ending battle! I'm sure anyone reading this would agree!

I started practicing solutions to common whiteboard problems and console.logging throughout my solutions to try help myself understand what was happening. I thought maybe this might help someone else as well.

So why not share.

This is just a simple collection of classic whiteboard problems and my solutions to those problems written in javascript, which can be run using [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with the following command.

```bash
node put\path\to\file-here.js
```

**Disclaimer: These solutions may not be optimal! Like I said, I never completed a CompSci degree** :sweat_smile:
